# Stack Data Structure in C++

This repository contains complete implementation of the **Stack** data structure in C++ along with important interview problems and optimizations.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

- Stack using Array
- Stack using Linked List (coming soon)
- Min Stack (Multiple Approaches)
- Space Optimized Min Stack
- Monotonic Stack Pattern

## 🚀 Implemented So Far

- Stack using Array (from scratch)

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Push      | O(1)       |
| Pop       | O(1)       |
| Peek      | O(1)       |
| isEmpty   | O(1)       |

## 🧠 Why Stack?

Stack follows **LIFO (Last In First Out)** principle and is widely used in:

- Valid Parentheses
- Expression Evaluation
- DFS Traversal
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Monotonic Stack problems

## 📈 Goal

This repository is part of my Data Structures & Algorithms practice journey focused on building strong fundamentals.
